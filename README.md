# Anomaly Detection Project

**Author:** Meriem Amrane  
**Project Type:** Machine Learning / Anomaly Detection / Python  
**Status:** In Development / Complete  

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **anomaly detection** using Python and machine learning. It demonstrates how to explore data, build, and deploy a model capable of identifying anomalies in datasets. The repository also includes a simple **web application** for real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Interactive Jupyter notebook to analyze and preprocess data (`Data_Exploration.ipynb`).  
- **Modeling:** Anomaly detection model implemented in Python (`anomaly_model.py`).  
- **Deployment:** Simple Flask app for serving the model (`app.py`).  
- **Versioning:** Git LFS is configured for handling large model files.  
- **Dependencies:** All required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
